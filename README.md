This is Etherium Test Application!
As a result of the work done, we figured out the structure of the application, implemented using the NestJS framework. We also studied a lot of information related to Blockchain and smart contracts and understood the scheme of using Web3JS.
In addition, we figured out how TypeORM works and how to work with it correctly.
Most of the time was spent studying the concept of smart contracts and their subtleties.
Knowing this initially, we could complete this task in a few hours.

P.S.: purely for myself, I would like to know why you chose exactly
NodeJS + NestJS? Why not C# ASP.NET Core?
